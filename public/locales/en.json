      "questionOne": "Can more than one person log in to the Thoth Merchant Panel?",
      "answerOne": "\nWithin the same Merchant Panel, you can generate multiple API keys. These keys allow multiple individuals to access the API. You also have the option to share the wallet seed which grants multiple users access to the same Merchant Panel. However, we strongly advise against this because anyone with the seed phrase can gain access to the Merchant Panel.\n",
      "questionTwo": "Which currencies are supported?",
      "answerTwo": "\nThe cryptocurrencies we support for receiving are:\n\n- BTC (onchain, Lightning Network, Liquid Network)\n- ETH\n- USDT (Erc20, Trc20, Bep20, Plg20, Liquid Network)\n- BUSD (Bep20)\n- Tron\n- Matic\n- BNB\n- Stellar XLM\n- EURMTL (euro stablecoin in Montenegro)\n\nFor fiat currencies used for pricing, refer to the table in the merchant manual.\n",
      "questionThree": "How do I get started with the API?",
      "answerThree": "\nVisit <a href=\"https://thothpay.com/merchant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://thothpay.com/merchant</a>, scan the QR code with Blixt Wallet, and then use your profile on the dashboard to obtain your API token and the URL for the API documentation.\n",
      "questionFour": "What is the URL to connect to the API?",
      "answerFour": "\nDetails for the API can be found here: <a href=\"https://thothpay.com/swagger/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://thothpay.com/swagger/index.html</a>\n",
      "questionFive": "Does Thothpay offer a withdrawal page? Or can withdrawals only be done from our wallet?",
      "answerFive": "\nThothpay allows merchants to initiate withdrawals either through the Web UI at thothpay.com/merchant or via the API. Merchants should initiate withdrawals on behalf of their clients.\n",
      "questionSix": "Can users withdraw from their trading account to their wallet?",
      "answerSix": "\nUsers can withdraw in any cryptocurrency through API calls from the CRM to Thothpay. However, the CRM must manage individual user balances. Thothpay only manages the aggregate balance of the entire merchant account.\n",
      "questionSeven": "How do we get started with deposits using the API key on Swagger?",
      "answerSeven": "\nUse the API key in the header to authenticate endpoints in Swagger. The 'k1' is used for authentication in the merchant panel, not for the API. After obtaining the API key from your profile page, you can authenticate it with any API endpoint.\n",
      "questionEight": "Which API endpoints should we use for deposits in Swagger?",
      "answerEight": "\nFor deposits, refer to the POST /api/invoice endpoint. When pricing in dollars, use \"currency\" : { \"Fiat\": \"Usd\"}. Remember, 1 USD is represented as 100 in the amount field, as the API always uses the smallest unit of the currency.\n",
      "questionNine": "What is the base URL for the API?",
      "answerNine": "\nThe base URL is <a href=\"https://thothpay.com/api/invoice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://thothpay.com/api/invoice</a>. In Swagger, you can view a curl example by selecting \"Try it out\" followed by \"Execute\".\n",
      "questionTen": "Should the callback URL use the POST or GET method?",
      "answerTen": "\nPOST\n",
      "questionEleven": "After creating the key, what's the next step?",
      "answerEleven": "\nThe key should be used in the request's HTTP headers for the API. Instructions and examples can be found in the interactive documentation (Swagger) at <a href=\"https://thothpay.com/swagger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://thothpay.com/swagger</a>\n",
      "questionTwelve": "What should I do if I encounter an error while testing the API?",
